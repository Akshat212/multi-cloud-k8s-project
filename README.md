# Multi-Cloud Kubernetes Project
**Project Goal**: Deploy a Kubernetes application across Google GKE and Azure AKS clusters, with Istio for multi-cluster service mesh and monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana.

## Checkpoints

### Checkpoint 1: Project Initialization and Repository Setup
- Created a GitHub repository for tracking project progress.
- Set up an initial README with an outline and structure for the project.

### Checkpoint 2: Primary Cluster Setup on GKE
- Setting up the GKE cluster with minimal-cost resources.
- Configuring kubectl access and validating the cluster.

*(List other checkpoints here with brief descriptions)*

## Project Structure
- `docs/`: Documentation and setup instructions.
- `k8s/`: Kubernetes YAML manifests for deployments and services.
- `istio/`: Istio configuration files.
- `monitoring/`: Prometheus and Grafana configuration.

## Getting Started
- Ensure you have kubectl, gcloud, az CLI, and Istio installed for the setup.
- Follow the steps under each checkpoint to build and test the multi-cloud infrastructure.
